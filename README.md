## We have include the following 2 E-Commerce Android app security features in this respository :
- [PCI-DSS compliance](#section-1) 
- [Fraud Detection](#section-2)

# <a name="section-1">
## 1. PCI-DSS Compliance :

### 1. **Use Secure Payment Gateways**

Ensure that you are using **PCI-DSS compliant payment gateways** like Stripe, PayPal, or Razorpay for handling all sensitive card data. Never process or store credit card details directly in your app.

```kotlin
fun startPayment(amount: Double) {
    val paymentGateway = PaymentGateway()
    paymentGateway.processPayment(amount, userCardInfo)
}
```

### 2. **Use Strong Encryption for Sensitive Data**

For any sensitive data (e.g., user authentication details, tokens), use **encryption** (AES, RSA) to protect data both **in transit** and **at rest**.

```kotlin
fun encryptData(data: String, secretKey: SecretKey): ByteArray {
    val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey)
    return cipher.doFinal(data.toByteArray(Charsets.UTF_8))
}
```

#### Important Steps:
1. **Tokenization**: Use tokenization to replace sensitive card details with a unique token that can be used for transaction processing without exposing card information.
2. **Strong Authentication**: Use **biometric authentication** or **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for secure payments.
3. **Network Security**: Ensure all communication with servers uses **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)** to protect against data interception.

## 2. Fraud Detection :

To implement **fraud detection** in Android, especially in e-commerce apps, you can identify suspicious transaction behavior using a combination of real-time monitoring, machine learning models, and security measures. Here's how you can achieve this:

### 1. **Transaction Monitoring Using Behavioral Analytics**

Monitor transactions for unusual patterns such as large purchases, location changes, or abnormal usage times. You can use **Firebase Analytics** or custom analytics to track user behavior.

```kotlin
fun monitorTransaction(amount: Double, location: String) {
    val normalLimit = 1000.0
    if (amount > normalLimit || isLocationSuspicious(location)) {
        flagTransactionAsSuspicious()
    }
}

fun isLocationSuspicious(location: String): Boolean {
    // Implement logic to check if location deviates from user's usual locations
    return location != "User'sUsualLocation"
}

fun flagTransactionAsSuspicious() {
    // Notify backend or block the transaction
    println("Transaction flagged as suspicious!")
}
```

### 2. **Machine Learning for Fraud Detection**

Integrate **ML models** trained on transaction data to detect fraud patterns, such as unexpected purchase behavior or rapid multiple transactions. Use frameworks like **TensorFlow Lite** to run models on the device.

```kotlin
fun runFraudDetectionModel(transactionData: TransactionData): Boolean {
    val tfliteModel = loadTFLiteModel("fraud_detection_model.tflite")
    val prediction = tfliteModel.run(transactionData)
    return prediction.isFraud
}
```

#### Important Steps:
1. **Monitor Transaction Anomalies**: Track transaction size, time, and frequency. Flag deviations from normal behavior.
2. **Real-Time Alerts**: Send real-time alerts for transactions flagged as suspicious based on predefined rules or ML models.
